## Dependencies

This project needs `python-colorama` (see [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt))
and a unicode-compatible terminal emulator (to render the playing cards).

It is recommended to play with a relatively high font size to make the cards
readable.

## Documentation

See the `help` command in game. Most commands can also be shortened to their
initials, and the `to` in the `move` command can be omitted.
